		<h1>Pace Institute</h1>
		<p>PACE Institute, being an innovative professional education institution, takes a fresh perspective towards professional education. Abbreviated for Professional Academic and Cognitive Excellence, PACE is a top-caliber professional education institute that provides an array of comprehensive professional educational programmes while instilling in students soft skills and values that are most sought-after by today’s employers.

Based on the concept of ‘producing value employees’, we aim to make a far-reaching positive difference in occupation-based education. We venture beyond the conventional methods and provide the students with a wider variety of expertise and aptitudes than mere credentials.</p>
